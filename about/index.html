  <h2>Hi!  My name is Chris and I'm a Software Developer.</h2>

  There's a lot of pretentious names that we creators of code have given
  ourselves, with lots of silly nuances, but that's the one I've chosen for
  myself.
</p>
<p>
  As <a href="https://github.com/chall8908?tab=repositories">my portfolio</a>
  suggests, my primary area of expertise is the browser. I don't stop there,
  though.  My work has taken me all the way into the database and back again.
  People tell me that makes me a &ldquo;Full Stack&rdquo; Developer.  I like to
  think I've just learned my tools.
</p>
<p>
  As this site has shown, design is not my strong suit.  I'm not completely
  inept - I do understand usability and user experience - but the graphical and
  artistic sides of web development has always illuded me.  This little blog is
  my on-going experiment in improving on that failing.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond my work, I'm an avid gamer, dabbling drummer, and voracious reader.
  I've been known to engage in editing, both of the written word and code.  In
  the latter case, enough that some of my friends have taken to calling me a
  &ldquo;Code Gardener&rdquo;.
