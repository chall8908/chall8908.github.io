<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>Welcome to my uncomplicated blog!</p>
<p>
  As a programmer by trade, it was very difficult for me to resist the allure of
  making this blog some massive technical undertaking that only works in 5% of
  browsers.  As you can see, I've done my best to keep this simple.  Instead,
  focusing on that aspect of the web I am least proficient with.
</p>
<p>Design.</p>
<p>
  As such, while the posts themselves will likely be ramble-y and mostly
  technical, my primary goal with this blog is to improve my design and writing
  skills.
<p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
